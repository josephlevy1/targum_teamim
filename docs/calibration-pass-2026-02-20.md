# Calibration Pass Report (2026-02-20)

- Dataset: synthetic 10-page manuscript calibration set
- Witness: calibration_synthetic_p1
- Pages processed: 10

## Results
- Mean OCR confidence: 0.820
- Mean OCR coverage estimate: 0.880
- Split partial count: 0
- Split success count: 10

## Notes
- Flow executed end-to-end: ingest -> region annotate -> OCR -> split.
- OCR runner used command-json mock for calibration repeatability.
- Replace with real manuscript assets for production calibration and threshold tuning.
